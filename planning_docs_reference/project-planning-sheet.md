# Python Group Project Planning

## Steps to Get Started on the Project

1. Come up with an idea for your project with your group and create a Feature List for Instructor approval. Make sure to get instructor approval on your feature list before continuing on with your other design docs.
2. Start an empty git repository WITHOUT a readme and create a wiki in your repo to hold all of your design docs. Share your wiki with your project advisor.
3. The project starter repo will be released on Friday. Do not start coding until this is released AND you have finished your design docs!

## Daily Planning Schedule

The following schedule is a general guideline for how to proceed with project planning.

You do not need to follow this schedule exactly! We prefer to you to take time with your planning - it is ok to turn in your docs after their "due" dates.

Submit your design docs for review by tagging your project lead in your group slack channel with a link to your GitHub wiki page.
