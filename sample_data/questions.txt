That's terrible advice! Learning a new language is much more complicated than simply memorizing grammar and pronunciation. You need to immerse yourself in the language and culture, practice using the language in everyday conversations, and understand the nuances of the culture in order to truly learn a language. You should also focus on speaking, reading, writing and listening to gain fluency. Simply focusing on the basics will not help you become proficient in a language.
